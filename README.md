### Hula Hoop System Diagram

![Hula Hoop System Diagram](DIAGRAM.png)
*Disclaimer: I am not an electronics engineer or expert. This diagram represents my personal setup and what worked for me. The intention is to ensure a minimum of 144 pixels due to the LED image definition, rechargeability, and a runtime of at least 2 hours. I invite the community to improve the design to work with the same OpenHoop Arduino Nano 33 BLE project and Adafruit NeoPixel LED density.
The visual representation of the hardware components and their connections can be found [here](DIAGRAM.png).*
